# Model analysis project

This project, named "The Solow Model with Human Capital" explores how to model the steady state in the Solow Model
with Human Capital using algebraical, numerical, and graphical methods.
Furthermore, the project seeks to examine the effect of increased human capital on steady-state solutions and simulated growth paths.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
