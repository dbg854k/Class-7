# Data analysis project

The project, named "Women on Board," aims to explore the potential correlation between the C25 stock performance and the presence of female representation on boards of directors.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

I apply the **following datasets**:

1. C25F.csv (source: https://finans.dk/karriere/ECE15412780/danske-elitevirksomheder-naar-milepael-for-kvinder-i-ledelse/)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

#%pip install yfinance

#%pip install adjustText
